# WP-docker-basic
A basic Wordpress docker

Compiled from https://linoxide.com/setup-wordpress-docker-ubuntu-16-04/ on 15/11/2022

Put the yaml file in its own folder.
In a terminal cd to that folder, then run

```
docker-compose up
```

Edit the credentials in the yaml file if you want more control over them. Dont forget to change them in both services to be the same thing.
